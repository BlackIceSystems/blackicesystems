description: Risk assessments and process hazard analysis are the cornerstones of well-engineered projects. Executing these sessions allows identification of areas requiring improvement, and drives the safety in design process for the project team. The quality of a risk assessment can make the difference between project success or failure. Black Ice Systems provide facilitation services in a range of analysis techniques including HAZID, HAZOP, and What-If analysis. In addition to basic risk assessments, our background in functional safety allows us to facilitate SIL determination, category selection, and performance level selection. <br> Our facilitators have strong backgrounds in mining and materials handling, as well as experience in implementation of projects with functional safety, which allows us to deliver facilitation services that are high quality and cost effective. Contact us today to discuss how we can assist with your next risk assessment activity.
