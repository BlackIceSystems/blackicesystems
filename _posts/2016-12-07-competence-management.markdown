description: Competence management is formalised demonstration that your safety team has the skills and abilities necessary to execute their tasks effectively. A competence management system is a requirement of functional safety standards. More importantly, a competence management system assists you in evaluating current, and potential, team members for their suitability and areas in which they may need further experience or training. Safety system failures can easily arise through a lack of proper knowledge, skills, or experience - and these failures can go on to have large safety and cost impacts. Black Ice Systems can assist in the development and implementation of a competence management system, to ensure you have the right people with the right skills working on your project.
