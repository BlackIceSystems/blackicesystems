description: Competence management is formalised demonstration that your safety team has the skills and abilities necessary to execute their tasks effectively. A competence management system is a requirement of functional safety standards, but more importantly it assists you in evaluating current and potential team members for their suitability, and areas in which they may need further development or training. Safety system failures can easily arise through a lack of proper knowledge, skills, or experience - and can go on to have large safety and cost impacts. Black Ice Systems can assist in the development and implementation of a competence management system, to ensure you have the right people working on your project.
